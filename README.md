# free-energy
# The thermal_properties.yaml file was generated using the open source phonopy code. This file contains the 
# vibrational free energy and entropy for a range of temperatures.

# In this notebook, I calculate the total free energy using the data in the thermal_properties.yaml files and internal energy calculated using
# the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).
